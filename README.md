<p> The World is filled with Data, a lot of data [pictures, videos, text, music,... ]
    Machine learning provides means of deriving meaning from all of that data. Today not only is the data generated by people but also by phones, computers and other devices, the data is and will rapidly continue to grow. Machine learning will enable us to use this data to answer questions</p>
    <p> Using data which will is traning, as we will inform the creation of the predictive model, and then this predictive model can then be used on unseen data to answer questions.</p>
